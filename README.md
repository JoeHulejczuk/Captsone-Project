# Uno Lite program
This is a simplified version of the card game Uno.
It follows the same rules as Uno but does not include any action cards or wild cards.
When it is your turn to play, you can play a card that has the same colour or value as the previously laid card. 
The goal in the game is to be the first player to get rid of all of your cards.

# How to run
Install python3.
Clone this repository or download the code.

# How to play 
Play Uno against two computer opponents.
On your turn, you will see your hand shown as a list of cards with indexes for each card.
To play a card, enter the index number of the card you want to play.
If you cannot play any of the cards in your hand, you must draw a card from the deck.
The first player to run out of cards wins!
